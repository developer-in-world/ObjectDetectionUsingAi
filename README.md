## AI in Image Detection: Object Detection on Images using Python and OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use AI for object detection in images using Python and OpenCV.

**Dependencies:**

* OpenCV
* Tensorflow
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **Import libraries:**
    - cv2: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks
    - matplotlib.pyplot: Matplotlib library for plotting images
2. **Model and label paths:**
    - `config_file`: Path to the model's `.pbtxt` file
    - `frozen_model`: Path to the frozen inference graph `.pb` file
    - `file_name`: Path to the text file containing class labels
3. **Load model and labels:**
    - `model`: Load the detection model using `cv2.dnn.DetectionModel`
    - `classLabels`: Read the class labels from the text file
4. **Read image:**
    - `img`: Read the image using `cv2.imread`
5. **Set model parameters:**
    - `model.setInputSize`: Set the input size for the model
    - `model.setInputScale`: Set the input scale for the model
    - `model.setInputMean`: Set the input mean for the model
    - `model.setInputSwapRB`: Set whether to swap the red and blue channels
6. **Detect objects in the image:**
    - `ClassIndex`, `confidence`, `bbox`: Detect objects in the image using `model.detect`
7. **Draw bounding boxes and labels:**
    - For each detected object:
        - Draw a bounding box around the object using `cv2.rectangle`
        - Put the class label and confidence score above the bounding box using `cv2.putText`
8. **Display the image with bounding boxes:**
    - Convert the image to RGB format using `cv2.cvtColor`
    - Use `plt.imshow` to display the image with bounding boxes
    - Use `plt.show` to display the plot

**Readme:**

This Python code demonstrates how to use AI for object detection in images using OpenCV. The code uses a pre-trained SSD Mobilenet v3 Large model for object detection and displays the detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores. The user can specify the paths to the model files, image file, and class label file.

**Things to note:**

* Make sure you have installed all the required dependencies.
* Replace the paths to the model files, image file, and class label file with your own paths.
* You can adjust the confidence threshold to filter out low-confidence detections.
* You can modify the code to detect specific classes of objects.

**Further enhancements:**

* Use a different object detection model
* Track the detected objects across frames in a video
* Implement object counting or classification
* Create a user interface for easier interaction

I hope this helps! Feel free to explore and modify the code for your specific needs.
